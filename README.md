# MaTeX

Consider this. In this era, students whose curriculum involves mathematics are missing an essential tool for them to interact with tutors, teachers, and one other online. While this has shown to be difficult to adapt to, we believe that this may have opened doors to things that may not have been possible in the past.

We are introducing MaTeX, a web application which drives the collaboration of algebraic and geometric tools with mathematicians worldwide.

A user is allowed to:

* Simply go to any web-hosted portal
* Create an instance of a room
* Share it with whoever you want to be able to join
* Create text documents to write accompanying ideas
* Write mathematical equations that can be graphed and further analyzed
* Draw graphs that can help explain ideas using diagrams

Our application is powered by a Fluence Network backend, using a React front-end and TypeScript as a powerful, syntactical programming language.

**Being that our application is extremely extensible, we plan on including:**

* Cryptocurrency Tipping
* Mentorship
* A means of vocalizing the thoughts of mathematicians through an audio feed
* Adding shapes and various utensils to our drawing board.

**Programmers on the team:**

* Nicky Pockinkov - Third year theoretical Physics Student at Trinity College, Dublin
* Sabrina Reyes - Third year Computer Science student at City College of New York

We'd like to thank FluenceLabs for being being the open-source, public, blockchain-based decentralized database platform we needed to build our components and allow for easy data integration.

We would also like to thank HoloChain for advising us as we were juggling great ideas in the midst of an approximately 30 hour sprint.
