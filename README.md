In this era, students whose curriculum involves mathematics are missing an essential tool for them to interact with tutors, teachers, and one another online. Though this has been shown to be difficult to adapt to, we believe this may open doors to things not possible in the past.

A user is allowed to:

* Simply go to any web-hosted portal
* Create an instance of a room
* Share it with whoever you want to be able to join
* Create text documents to write accompanying ideas
* Write mathematical equations that can be graphed and further analyzed
* Draw graphs that can help explain ideas using diagrams

Our application is powered by a Fluence Network backend, using a React front-end and TypeScript as a powerful, syntactical programming language.

Programmers on the team:

* Nicky Pockinkov - Third year theoretical Physics Student at Trinity College, Dublin
* Sabrina Reyes - Third year Computer Science student at City College of New York
